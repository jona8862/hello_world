# hello_world
This is Jonathan, I'm doing a test with GitHub. It seems to be a nice version controller to my program. Once I can completely understand the operation, I can upload my project to Github to control my version and reduce the risk whenever I forgot which version is what I've done in past and what I did in changes.
